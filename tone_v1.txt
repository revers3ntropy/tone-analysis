I'm not sure where you're getting your information, but it's not accurate. || Caustic
If you want to be taken seriously, you might want to try being less ridiculous. || Caustic
I'm not sure what's more offensive, your ignorance or your arrogance. || Caustic
Your lack of intelligence is truly astounding. || Caustic
Sorry, I don't have time to listen to your nonsense. || Caustic
Your delusions of grandeur are amusing, to say the least. || Caustic
I'm not sure why you bother speaking, considering the nonsense that comes out of your mouth. || Caustic
You might want to work on your delivery if you want to be taken seriously. || Caustic
Your comments are about as helpful as a flat tire. || Caustic
If you're trying to impress me, you're failing miserably. || Caustic
I'm not sure where you're getting your information, but it's definitely not from a credible source. || Caustic
Sorry, I'm not interested in hearing your opinion. || Caustic
Your lack of intelligence is truly remarkable. || Caustic
I'm not sure why you're wasting your breath on this matter. || Caustic
If ignorance is bliss, you must be in a constant state of euphoria. || Caustic
I'm not sure how you managed to become so uninformed. || Caustic
Don't worry, you'll be the first to know when I actually care about your opinion. || Caustic
Oh, did I hurt your feelings? I didn't realize you had any. || Caustic
I'm not saying you're stupid, but I'm pretty sure you could find your way out of a paper bag. || Caustic
Sorry, I can't help you with your problems. I have my own to deal with. || Caustic
Wow, you really know how to make a bad situation worse. || Caustic
I'm not sure if you're being intentionally dense or if it's just your natural state. || Caustic
You're like a broken record, repeating the same thing over and over again. || Caustic
You're not going to win any awards for originality with that idea. || Caustic
I'm not in the mood for your attitude today. || Caustic
You're not even worth the energy it takes to argue with you. || Caustic
Congratulations, you just won the award for most annoying person of the day. || Caustic
Excuse me, but I don't remember asking for your opinion. || Caustic
Please, spare me the drama. I have enough of my own. || Caustic
Your ignorance is truly astounding. || Caustic
If you think you're being clever, you're not. || Caustic
I don't have time for this nonsense. || Caustic
I'm not going to pretend to care about what you're saying. || Caustic
You're not as clever as you think you are. || Caustic
You're not worth the effort it takes to argue with you. || Caustic
I'm not interested in playing games with you. || Caustic
If you're looking for sympathy, you're not going to find it here. || Caustic
Sorry, I don't have the patience for your nonsense. || Caustic
You're like a mosquito that won't go away. || Caustic
I think it's time for you to leave now. || Caustic
You're not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, are you? || Caustic
Your stupidity is truly remarkable. || Caustic
I'm not going to hold your hand through this. || Caustic
Sorry, I don't have the time or the inclination to listen to your whining. || Caustic
You're like a bad smell that won't go away. || Caustic
I don't have to listen to your nonsense if I don't want to. || Caustic
Sorry, I don't have the patience to deal with your drama. || Caustic
You're not exactly a rocket scientist, are you? || Caustic
Sorry, but your opinion is irrelevant to me. || Caustic
I'm sorry if my honesty offends you, but I won't sugarcoat the truth. || Caustic
Wow, you really think you're all that, don't you? || Caustic
I don't care what you think about me, I know who I am. || Caustic
I hope you don't mind if I don't care about your opinion. || Caustic
Did you even try to do your job, or are you just incompetent? || Caustic
You're not as smart as you think you are, you know. || Caustic
Please spare me your sob story, I have my own problems to deal with. || Caustic
I'm not going to pretend that everything is okay when it's not. || Caustic
You're not the only one who's busy, you know. || Caustic
Do you ever stop to think before you speak, or is that too much to ask? || Caustic
I'm sorry, but your work just isn't up to par. || Caustic
You're not entitled to my time or attention. || Caustic
If you want my respect, you're going to have to earn it. || Caustic
I'm not interested in hearing your excuses. || Caustic
You're wasting my time with all this nonsense. || Caustic
You're not fooling anyone with your fake smile and empty words. || Caustic
I don't have time for your drama and games. || Caustic
Sorry, I don't suffer fools gladly. || Caustic
If you can't handle the truth, that's not my problem. || Caustic
I don't need your approval to be happy. || Caustic
Don't try to make me feel bad just because you screwed up. || Caustic
I'm not going to pretend to like you when I don't. || Caustic
Did you seriously just say that to me? || Caustic
You're not the boss of me. || Caustic
Sorry, but I don't have any sympathy for someone who brought their problems on themselves. || Caustic
I'm not going to apologize for telling the truth. || Caustic
I don't need your help, I can do this on my own. || Caustic
You really don't get it, do you? || Caustic
If you don't have anything useful to say, please keep your mouth shut. || Caustic
I'm not impressed by your antics, sorry. || Caustic
You can keep your opinions to yourself, thanks. || Caustic
Sorry, I'm not in the mood to deal with your drama right now. || Caustic
Don't act like you're better than me, you're not. || Caustic
Sorry, but I don't trust you. || Caustic
I'm not going to pretend to be nice just to make you feel better. || Caustic
Did you seriously just try to blame me for your mistakes? || Caustic
I don't have time for your negativity and complaining. || Caustic
Sorry, but your behavior is unacceptable. || Caustic
I'm not going to let you walk all over me. || Caustic
Sorry, but I'm not interested in hearing your life story. || Caustic
You really need to learn some manners. || Caustic
I'm not going to let you bully me into doing something I don't want to do. || Caustic
Sorry, but I don't think you're as great as you think you are. || Caustic
You're not going to intimidate me with your tough-guy act. || Caustic
I don't have the patience for your nonsense. || Caustic
Sorry, but I don't believe you. || Caustic
I'm not going to pretend to be someone I'm not just to fit in. || Caustic
Did you really just say that to my face? || Caustic
I don't owe you anything, so don't expect me to do anything for you. || Caustic
Sorry, but I'm not interested in your opinion. || Caustic
